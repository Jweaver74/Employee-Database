  ## Description
  To be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employee's within a company so that the owner can organize and plan.


  ## Installation
  Clone the repo and open in VScode. Start the terminal from the db and enter into your sequel shell. Run source for the schema and seeds.sql and exit. Open the terminal from the root directory and run npm i, then npm start. You will be prompted with a series of questions to answer. Once you have answered all the questions, you will be able to view the database.



  ## Tests
  Run the schema and seeds.sql from the sequel shell and if errors are present they will pop up. Also when running the app from the root directory you will get errors pretaining to the entered command.
